    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook contains example workflow for web services exposed by the EIDA (European Integrated Data Archive) Federation, focused on the EIDAWS-WFCatalog service and its functionalities allowing users to filter out low quality and low coverage data before downloading it to the local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve seismic event information from FDSNWS-Event catalogue offered by [GFZ](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/) EIDA Node:\n",
    "    * Start date = 2020-01-01\n",
    "    * End date = 2020-06-01\n",
    "    * Minimum magnitude = 5\n",

    "    * Maximum latitude = 45\n",
    "    * Minimum longitude = 17\n",
    "    * Maximum longitude = 25\n",
    "1. List all stations available in proximity to given event using [FDSNWS-Station](https://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/eida/webservices/station/) web service\n",
    "1. Using [EIDAWS-WFCatalog](https://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/eida/webservices/wfcatalog/) service, we are going to exclude all stations which do not meet following criteria:\n",
    "    * At least 95% data coverage on the day of the event\n",
    "    * Maximum of 5 gaps\n",
    "    * Sum of gaps lower than 50 seconds\n",
    "    * No overlaps\n",
    "1. Using [FDSNWS-Dataselect](https://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/eida/webservices/dataselect/) web service, we are going to download:\n",
    "    * miniSEED file containing the waveforms\n",
    "    * StationXML file containing station and instrumentation metadata on channel level\n",
    "1.
